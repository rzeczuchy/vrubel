            <h2>Mikhail Vrubel</h2>
            <p>
              Born a fragile and unhealthy child, Mikhail Vrubel displayed
              artistic inclinations early, but only decided to pursue a career
              as an artist in his mid-twenties, when he started attending the
              Imperial Academy of Arts.
            </p>
            <p>
              In his work he took inspiration from religious art, Russian
              romantic painters (such as Ivan Aivazovsky), as well as theatre
              and literature. Despite obvious talent and some acclaim among his
              peers, Vrubel never graduated from the Academy. Instead he went on
              to pursue a commercial career as both a religious painter and
              portretist. His most productive years followed, during which the
              artists painted some of his most stunning works, including the
              "Demon" series.
            </p>
            <p>
              His late years were marred by mental illness and depression, and
              Vrubel was then hardly able to paint. Even so, a couple of his
              better-known works (like the <em>Six-winged Seraph</em>, 1904)
              were produced during this period, indicating his artistic senses
              were still sharp at times. He left behind a legacy that was rare
              and defiant.

              <h3>The Demon Seated</h3>
              <p>
                Inspired by a 1839 romantic poem by Mikhail Lermontov, it
                depicts the brooding Demon sitting alone amongst the mountains
                of the Caucassus. This was one of a series of paintings
                depicting Lermontov's Demon that Vrubel produced between year
                1890 and his death in 1910.

            <div class="description pad-left">
              <h3>The Swan Princess</h3>
              <p>
                Based on <em>The Tale of Tsar Sultan</em> opera by
                Rimsky-Korsakov, for which Vrubel himself designed the costumes.
                The part of the Swan Princess was played by Nadezhda
                Zabela-Vrubel, Mikhail's wife. Although some point out that the
                face in the painting does not resemble that of his spouse
                closely, it is similar to the artist's other idealised
                depictions of his wife.
              </p>
              <p>
                Vrubel met Nadezhda in 1896, during her rehearsal in the opera,
                and apparently was instantly enamoured, proposing shortly after
                to the much younger singer. Their relationship was short-lived,
                as the artist was kept from seeing his wife in the latter part
                of his life, due to his deteriorating mental condition.

              <h3>The Demon Downcast</h3>
              <p>
                Although based around the same topic as the 1890's
                <em>The Demon Seated</em>, this entry in the "Demon" series
                seems to constitute a departure from the literary theme of
                Lermontov's poem. It depicts the Demon lying on the ground in a
                contorted position, his expression terrifying and full of
                anguish. By the time the painting was finished, Vrubel was
                already suffering heavily from the symptoms of his mental
                illness.

              <h3>Six-winged Seraph (Azrael)</h3>
              <p>
                Alternatively titled <em>Azrael</em> after the Angel of Death
                from Jewish/ Islamic tradition, the fierce Seraph holds up a
                dagger in one hand and a half-empty hourglass in another.
              </p>
              <p>
                Inspired in turn by Alexander Pushkin's <em>The Prophet</em>,
                this 131x155cm painting was one of the last large-scale works
                Vrubel produced. At the time, the previously negative public
                reception of his style was starting to reverse. For the two
                years of his career as an artist, Vrubel's work finally enjoyed
                some much deserved recognition.
