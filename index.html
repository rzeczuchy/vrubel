            <h2>Mikhail Vrubel</h2>
            <p>
              Born a fragile and unhealthy child, Mikhail Vrubel displayed
              artistic inclinations early, but only decided to pursue a career
              as an artist in his mid-twenties, when he started attending the
              Imperial Academy of Arts.
            </p>
            <p>
              In his work he took inspiration from religious art, Russian
              romantic painters (such as Ivan Aivazovsky), as well as theatre
              and literature. Despite obvious talent and some success, Vrubel
              never graduated from the Academy. Instead he went on to pursue a
              commercial career as both a religious painter and portretist. His
              most productive years followed, during which the artists painted
              some of his most acclaimed works, including the "Demon" series.
            </p>
            <p>
              His late years were marred by mental illness and depression, and
              Vrubel was then hardly able to paint. Even so, a couple of his
              better-known works (like the <em>Six-winged Seraph</em>, 1904)
              were produced during this period, indicating his artistic senses
              were still sharp at times. He left behind a legacy that was
              defiant and unforgettable.
